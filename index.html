                        Hello, I'm Ansh Gupta - a Tech Aficionado, Aspiring DSA, and Web Development Enthusiast.

I've been immersed in technology since 7th grade, running a tech blog and nurturing my passion for all things tech. Currently pursuing B.Tech in CSE at Lovely Professional University, fostering my curiosity for technology.

In my journey, I've developed strong programming skills, honing my expertise in C++, Python, and web development. I'm open to exciting opportunities, eager to collaborate, and here to help organizations make innovative strides with my coding prowess.

I'm here to help organizations make innovative strides by leveraging my programming skills, while constantly pushing boundaries and seeking new avenues for growth.

Eager to collaborate and learn, I'm open to exciting opportunities in tech projects, research, and connecting with industry professionals.

                <h4>Founder and Blogger</h4>
                <p>
                    In 7th grade, I started my own tech blog website and wrote for 2 years and 7 months. I embarked on an exhilarating journey as a tech blog writer. Little did I know that this experience would shape my future and ignite a lifelong passion for technology.
It was an exhilarating journey, from humble beginnings to building an audience and expanding my knowledge and felt the impact of my writing. This experience ignited a lifelong passion for both technology and writing, influencing my academic and career choices.

                <h3>Dailyhunt</h3>
                <h4>Tech content writer</h4>
                <p>
                    After joining Dailyhunt as a tech blog writer for 11 months, my journey took an exciting turn. Within less than 4 months, I gained 7k followers, and my blog's reach soared. The experience at Dailyhunt allowed me to connect with a larger audience, learn from fellow professionals, and improve my writing skills. This rapid growth and recognition further fueled my passion for tech writing, making it a truly fulfilling and rewarding adventure.

As my tech blog gained popularity and my followers increased, I found myself struggling to balance my haptic writing and academic studies. The demands of maintaining a successful blog left me with little time for anything else. Realizing the importance of my intermediate academic studies, I made the difficult decision to prioritize them over my writing endeavors.

I shifted my focus solely to my studies, dedicating myself to excel in my academic pursuits. While I missed the thrill of tech, I knew that investing in my education would provide a strong foundation for my future.

Though I had to step away from my tech blog temporarily, I am grateful for the invaluable experiences and skills it provided. As I embrace this new chapter, I carry with me the passion for writing and technology, ready to explore opportunities that lie ahead once my academic journey is complete. </p>
